## Thoughts
- App started by calling a HTML file that is the "skin" of the scoring page
- Scorable elements are marked with a specific class in the element that turns them into tally-able items
- Two starting scoring items are "Yes/No (did a thing, did not), and incrementable tally"
- The spreadsheet analysis pages may not be skinnable
- The scoring page should have the match and team selection added in automatically
- Review and submit should auto build, reproducing the text and or icons used in the skin
- Code injections marked with "easy to find" markers for test verification
- Team and match data from the FRC events API?
- Need packaged test data and a test mode from cli
- references to needed engine javascript added to end
- Required cli entries:
    - first_events_API_key: The team's registered API key
    - first_event_ID: The first event we want to load and score (used to populate team database)
- Have to figure out what to do with skeleton vs. not skeleton; advanced users can replace?
- The classes for scoring items have to be applied to the tapped element itself.  Not the divs.  I think this will limit my background feedback.  But this can't be perfect.
- Need to generate fully formed template file when asked
- DB of file inputs that have been validated?  Validate should be separate command to get feedback
- Config file also?  With the API key and eventID?  Generated auto?  It really could be in the markup file.  But we shouldn't need to remake a markup file for each event.  Yes, TOML I think with set up assistance
- Mode shift should, maybe, hide and show those items with data-onlyForMode?
- I can separate logic for the mechanics part of the scoring and the animation
    - Option setting to not set animation, already set by the team
- Command line setting of static files directory?  Defaults to the package.  Easier to just tell people to edit the static dir?
- I think if no "head" is found, then it adds the desired one.
- The code that is added is only for the scoring mechanics.  Formatting and other effects are left to the user.
- The template is a fully formed and realized version
- Test mode to check visuals needed.  Scoring JS checks for presence of test=True param


### Added classes

- match_selection: where the match selection div will be added, if not give, will put at front of body
- review_and_submit: Where the autogenerated review and submit will be placed (will be auto-appended if missing)
- error_modal: place holder for error messages (auto-append)
- sending_data_modal: place holder for the (auto-append)
- scoring: user defined scoring section 
- game_mode_group: So game modes can be mutually exclusive selected (superfluous?  Game mode can just be last selected)
- game_mode: ID the game mode DIVs
    - When game_mode changes, tallies and yes/no must be reset
- attr: data-modename: Official name of the mode, referenced by data-onlyForMode below
- score_tally: designate a tally score item
- attr: data-scorename: item name is defined in data-scorename attr
- score_flag: designate a true/false score item (default false)
- attr: data-onlyForMode: should define modes this can be tallied/registered for (tied to the defined "data-modename" attribute in the .game_mode)
- click_feedback: Will change the background color of this element when it's immediate descendent is clicked
